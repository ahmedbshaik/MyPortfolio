# MyPortfolio  - Responsive design
Credits - Lynda - Christina Truong
I completed HTML and CSS learning on Linkedin learning portal. I found this course CSS Essential Training created by Christina Truong.
The training uses the trainers own portfolio as an example to build simple website focused mainly on CSS.
Even though my portofolio is identical to trainer's portfolio, I have learned concept and practiced multiple times to create my own.
Coming up with more challenging web building projects, where I can show my skills and knowlede in the area.
Thanks!

My Portfolio has 5 sections.
1. Introduction - header
2. Projects
3. Work experience
4. Education
5. Contact - footer

Tried to utilise almost all concepts of CSS which I learned so far. Also tried to write code keeping best practice in-mind.
